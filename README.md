## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
##Introduction

this project is used to build an interactive responsive landing page by using js to add a navigation menu to the page

##How was it made
it was made by using query selector to get all the sections then creating links and appending the links to the navigation menu then an event listener was added to scroll to the section when the link is clicked another event listener was added so that if a users viewpoint falls on the section the active section is marked in the navigation menu. and finally a media query was used to remove the nav menu and add a menu bar to make it more interactive and efficient on small screens. An event listener was used here as well to reveal the navigation menu when the bar menu is clicked.
